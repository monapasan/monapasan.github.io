        <p class="text-l text-left w-80 py-2 font-light text-base">
          In our high paced and competitive professional environments where
          teams work under high pressure - stress, conflict and burnout are the
          top reasons why employees leave their jobs.
        </p>
        <p class="w-80 py-2 font-light text-base">
          Moreover, in the past 10 years in Germany the amount of sick leave
          days only due to burnout and mental issues increased by 56%.
        </p>
        <p class="w-80 py-2 font-light text-base">
          In order to cultivate cultures that embody professionalism and
          collaboration, workplaces need to provide their employees with
          regenerating moments and helpful tools to regulate their stress
          levels, transcend conflicts, build trust & achieve flow states as an
          aligned team.
