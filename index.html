          In our high paced and competitive professional environments where
          teams work under high pressure -
          <b>stress, conflict and burnout </b>are the top reasons why employees
          leave their jobs. <br /><br />Moreover, in the past 10 years in
          Germany the amount of sick leave days only due to burnout and mental
          issues increased by 56%. <br /><br />In order to cultivate cultures
          that <b>embody professionalism and collaboration</b>, workplaces need
          to provide their employees with
          <b>regenerating moments and helpful tools</b>
          to regulate their stress levels, transcend conflicts, build trust &
          <b>achieve flow states as an aligned team</b>.

            After some years in various start-ups and web3 companies, Ola left
            the corporate world to start her healing collective called Joy Space
            (link) in Berlin Mitte. By now, more than 40 practitioners are part
            of the healing community. Founding Zen experiences was the next
            logical step by bringing these kinds of services into the corporate
            world. Besides her entrepreneurial endeavors Ola is also a licensed
            Reiki practitioner.

            over 7 years of experience in the corporate world. Through her work

            environments need new approaches, to be able to survive the fast
            changing developments of our world. From her point of view, the most
            important thing for companies to be able to succeed in the future,
            is to provide their employees with nurturing work environments to
            help them reach their highest creative potential. Besides Zen
            Experiences and her freelance career as a consultant she also
